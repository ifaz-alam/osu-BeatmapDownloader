# osuBeatmapDownloader
Downloads osu! beatmaps from a .txt file containing missing beatmaps from Piotrekol's Collection Manager. As some beatmaps are not available for download on the official website, the program attempts to retrieve the files from the Chimu.moe and Sayobot osu! beatmap mirrors instead.
